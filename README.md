## Description
##### Week 4 independent project for Moringa School Prep.
The project entails creating a game of Pig Dice which meets the following criteria:
* As a user, I want to roll the dice when it's my turn to play in the game.
* As a user, I want to see the score I get for each roll of the dice I make in the game.
* As a user, I want to see my cumulative score for each round I play in the game.
* As a user, I want the option to hold my score when I'm satisfied with the points I've gained in a round of playing.
* As a user, I want to be alerted when my dice rolls on number 1. 
* As a user, I need a way to know which player has won the game, which means they have scored 100 points before the alternate player.
It involves cloning a remote github repo which has the asset files for building the page.  It also has a jpg of what the expected outcome of Delani Studio website should look like.  
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* jQuery 3.4.0 was used here.
* Bootstrap 4.
* Git knowledge on how to clone a repo.
